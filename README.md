### About me
Hi, my name is Joshua Wiegmann and I am a software developer from Hannover (Germany). Actually I am a Java developer, but I am on my way to become a fullstack developer. Currently I'm working on the basics of frontend development and try to lay a good foundation for my further frontend path.
